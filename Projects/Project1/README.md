# Project 1; Project Euler problems 125, 302, and 307

### Collaborators ~> Sam Disharoon & Jordan Welch

Project Euler is a website that has numerous problems of a wide range of difficulty. Our task was to choose three of these problems, one of each of at least 10th, 40th, and 60th percentile, and solve them using what we have learned about MPI and to take advantage of the HPCL cluster.

## Problem 1; Palindromic Sums

### Description

The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 0^2 + 1^2 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than 108 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.
