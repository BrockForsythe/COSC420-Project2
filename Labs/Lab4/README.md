# Lab 4; Calculating Eigenvectors & Parallelizing the Data

### Collaborators: Sam Disharoon & Jordan Welch

## Description

This lab increases our matrix library that we have been working on over the past 2 labs.  This time, we added functions to calculate an Eigenvector to correspond with the largest Eigenvalue of a given matrix.  The functions included are Normalize, normalize-2, and eigenvector.
